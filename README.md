# Famine Database (Beta)

This folder contains the **Beta version** of the *Compilation of Select Famines and Food Disruptions Around the World*, a curated dataset synthesizing documented famine events from historical literature and humanitarian assessments.

**File:** `famine_database.xlsx`  
**Status:** **Beta** — actively being expanded and refined.

## Description

This dataset provides structured information on historical and contemporary famine events, including primary drivers, environmental context, duration, and documented impacts.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Primary Cause** | Main initiating drivers (e.g., drought, conflict, policy controls, economic collapse). |
| **Environmental Category** | Type of environmental stress or absence thereof (Drought, Floods, Volcanic Event, Minor/None). |
| **Start Year** | Approximate onset year of the event. |
| **Year(s)** | Duration or period notation (e.g., AD 1991–1992, AD 2016–present). |
| **Impacts** | Notes on mortality, crop losses, price dynamics, displacement, or humanitarian conditions. Excess mortality values are approximate. |
| **Reference(s)** | Academic publications, historical documentation, and/or humanitarian agency reports supporting the entry. |

## Beta Release Notes

- This dataset is a **select compilation**, not an exhaustive global list.
- Values for mortality, affected population, and timing represent **best estimates** from published sources.
- Some events are primarily driven by **conflict, governance, and movement restrictions**, rather than environmental shock.
- Sub-national granularity will **expand** as region-specific sources are reviewed.

This dataset is intended for **research, teaching**, and **method development** and **should not yet be used for operational early warning** without contextual validation.
